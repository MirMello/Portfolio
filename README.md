Miranda's Portfolio

In my header I have a recent photo of me and my name next to it. I also have fuctional links in my navigation.

I have a section "about me"

I have a section of my projects, with my first project larger than the others. I used iframes for my projects and the link to each projects url is on the title.

I have a section with my contact information

I have added flex to my website to make it able to be seen on various screens and devices
